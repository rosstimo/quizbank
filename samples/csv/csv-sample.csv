course.types.001,mcq_one,2,"Example > Basics",easy,"types,booleans","Which type represents truth values in most languages?",Integer,Float,Boolean,Character,,"C",,,,"Exactly. Boolean is the truth type.","It's Boolean, not the others.","The Boolean type has two values: `true` and `false`."
course.algos.002,mcq_multi,2,"Example > Algorithms",medium,"sorting","Which are comparison-based sorting algorithms? Select all that apply.",Merge sort,Counting sort,Radix sort,Quick sort,,"A,D",,,,"Correct: Merge and Quick sort compare elements.","Counting/Radix are not comparison-based.","Merge/Quick compare elements; Counting/Radix use key properties."
course.trees.003,true_false,1,"Example > Trees",easy,"bst,traversal","In a binary search tree, an in-order traversal yields sorted keys.",,,,,,,true,,,"Yep. That's the BST party trick.","For valid BSTs, in-order is sorted.","In-order visits left, node, right; keys are nondecreasing."
course.circuits.004,numeric,2,"Example > Circuits",easy,"ohms-law","A circuit has a current of 3 A through a resistor of 2 Ω. What is the voltage across the resistor?",,,,,,,,6,0.01,V,"Correct. V = I × R = 3 × 2 = 6 V.","Use V = I × R.","$V = I \cdot R = 3\,\text{A} \times 2\,\Omega = 6\,\text{V}$."
course.ds.005,short_answer,2,"Example > Data Structures",easy,"lifo,stack","Name the data structure that uses the LIFO discipline.",,,,,,,,,,,"Exactly. LIFO = stack.","You're thinking of a **stack**.","A **stack** removes the most recently pushed item first."
