  Which of the following are **comparison-based** sorting algorithms? Select all that apply.
choices:
  - text: Merge sort
    correct: true
    rationale: Classic divide-and-conquer, compares keys.
  - text: Quick sort
    correct: true
    rationale: Partitioning around pivots, compares keys.
  - text: Counting sort
    rationale: Uses counts of keys; not comparison-based.
  - text: Radix sort
    rationale: Distributes by digit/bucket; not comparison-based.
feedback:
  correct: "Nice. Merge and Quick are the comparison-based ones here."
  incorrect: "Remember: counting and radix sort avoid direct key comparisons."
solution: |
  **Merge sort** and **Quick sort** are comparison sorts; **Counting** and **Radix** are not.
