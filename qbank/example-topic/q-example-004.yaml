  A circuit has a current of `3 A` through a resistor of `2 Ω`.  
  What is the voltage across the resistor?
answer: 6
tolerance: 0.01
unit: V
feedback:
  correct: |
    Correct. Ohm’s law: \(V = I \cdot R = 3 \times 2 = 6\ \text{V}\).
  incorrect: |
    Use \(V = I \cdot R\). With 3 A and 2 Ω the result is 6 V.
solution: |
  \(V = I \cdot R = 3\ \text{A} \times 2\ \Omega = 6\ \text{V}\).
