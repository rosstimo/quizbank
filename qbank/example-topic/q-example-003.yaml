  In a binary search tree, an **in-order traversal** visits the keys in nondecreasing (sorted) order.
answer: true
feedback:
  correct: Yep. That’s the whole party trick of BSTs.

solution: |
  By definition of BST ordering, in-order traversal visits left subtree, node, right subtree, producing sorted keys.
